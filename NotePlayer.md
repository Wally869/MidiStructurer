# NotePlayer  

NotePlayer is a module built around the Soundcard library to enable the developer/composer to listen to his creation easily.  

It can play the sounds specified by any Structural Components (Notes, SoundEvents, Bars and Tracks) as pure Sine Waves.

This is a convenience module for when you're playing around on the Command Line and want to avoid generating a Midi File.
