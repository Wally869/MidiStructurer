# MusiStrata

MusiStrata is a pure Python library to represent and manipulate Musical Components.

The idea is to be able to create Notes, translate them using Tonal Distance and Intervals, generate Chords...   
Basically, support all operations useful in creating music algorithmically, through the use of Western Music Theory.

## Implementation  

MusiStrata defines Components to represent Musical Elements. There are 2 types:
- Basic Components (Notes, Scales, Intervals and Chords) which represent Notes and potential operations that can be applied to it to generate complex sequences of Notes.
- Structural Components (SoundEvents, Bars, Tracks and Songs) which allow us to structure our Notes into rhythmically defined sequences.
